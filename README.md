# THE MUSICIAN APP

As a third year project we, the scrum of the earth wits software design group, have been tasked with building an app that is specifically for musicians. This app will contain tools such as a metronome, a chromatic tuner, a beat loop maker and more. 

## Cloning and setup 

This app was made using ==pure react native== code, because some of the libraries and modules that were needed are not supported by expo cli. This simply means that there aren't all the bells and whistles in this project that would normally come with expo.

This just simply means that you'll have to make sure that your enviroment is setup before you can work on this app. 

## Steps
1. First you need to clone the app onto your machine. You can do this in anyway you like but I prefer to use the terminal and the command line:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SCRUM-OF-THE-EARTH/Musician.git
```
